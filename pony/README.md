# Example programs implemented with Pony Programing language

## Pony version

I installed it with `brew ponyc`

```
‚ùØ ponyc --version
0.33.1 [release]
compiled with: llvm 7.1.0 -- Apple clang version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)

```

## How to compile and run

Let `$PROJECT` be the name of the example to run

```bash
$ cd $PROJECT
$ ponyc . -b a.out
$ ./a.out
```
